# 📝 Assignment operators (<-, =) ####
num1 <- 7 # Assign the value 7 to the variable "num1"
num2 = 3  # Assign the value 3 to the variable "num2"
mass_kg <- 89.9 # Assign the value 89.9 to the variable "mass_kg"
height_m <- 1.91 # Assign the value 1.91 to the variable "height_m"
# Note: '<-' shortcut in RStudio: Alt + - (Windows)

# ➕ Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^) ####
num1 + num2 # Addition
sum(num1, num2) # Sum function
num1 - num2 # Subtraction
num1 * num2 # Multiplication
num1 / num2 # Division
num1 %/% num2 # Integer division
num1 %% num2 # Remainder (modulus)
num1^2 # Exponentiation (power)
BMI <- mass_kg / (height_m^2) # BMI calculation
BMI

# 🔢 Relational operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=) ####
num1 == num2 # Check if "num1" is equal to "num2"
num1 != num2 # Check if "num1" is not equal to "num2"
num1 < num2 # Check if "num1" is less than "num2"
num1 <= num2 # Check if "num1" is less than or equal to "num2"
num1 > num2 # Check if "num1" is greater than "num2"
num1 >= num2 # Check if "num1" is greater than or equal to "num2"

# ⚡ Logical operators (&, |, !) ####
num1 == num2 & num1 > num2 # AND operator: returns TRUE if both values are TRUE, otherwise FALSE
num1 == num2 | num1 > num2 # OR operator: returns TRUE if at least one value is TRUE, otherwise FALSE
!num1 == num2 # NOT operator: inverts the logical value of the boolean
